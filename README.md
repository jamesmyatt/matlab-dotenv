# matlab-dotenv

Reads the key,value pair from `.env` file and adds them to environment
variable. It is great for managing app settings during development and
in production using [12-factor](http://12factor.net/) principles.

Influences:

- Python: [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv)
- R: [dotenv](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/dotenv)

Plan is to follow the example of python-dotenv in the case of any conflicts.
